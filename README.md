# Javascript utility code
Various utility code that I've written, mainly for my own use and learning. Nonetheless I make an effort
to Unit Test code and test in real-world applications when possible.

## Base Type
provides extend() method which can be used for sub classing types.

## Dom Utils 
A collection of functions for DOM operations, including element selection and event delegation.

## Promises
An implementation of the [Promises/A+ specification](https://promisesaplus.com/).
Interoperable with other Promises/A+ compatible libraries (e.g. q).
Passes the A+ compliance tests

##  MVC Framework
A suite of facilities for data-binding and routing which facilitate the building of MVC applications.
An implementation of the todoMVC app using this framework can be found [here](https://richardinho.github.io/todo-mvc-for-richard-utils/).

## Sundry
Various utility functions used elsewhere in library but exported anyway.
